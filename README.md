This is the github repository for IJCNN 2025 eassy "CRAVE: A Conflicting Reasoning Approach for Explainable Claim Verification Using LLMs".

## Introduction
We propose CRAVE (Conflicting Reasoning Approach for explainable claim VErification), a novel framework that leverages conflicting rationales generated by large language models (LLMs) for explainable and accurate claim verification.CRAVE comprises three modules: (1) Ambiguity-Elimination Enhanced Evidence Retrieval, which refines entity-based searches to collect relevant evidence from sources like Wikipedia; (2) Conflicting Perspective Reasoning and Preliminary Judgment, where LLMs reason across four dimensions—direct evidence, semantic relationships, linguistic cues, and logical inference—to produce preliminary judgments; and (3) a Small Language Model (SLM)-based Judge, fine-tuned to assess the confidence of conflicting rationales and deliver a final authenticity verdict.Experiments on two public claim verification datasets show that CRAVE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with enhanced evidence retrieval and more interpretable predictions.
